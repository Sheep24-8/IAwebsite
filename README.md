# IAwebsite
###The purpose  of my the website is to show how does the air pollution like the  PM2.5, has changed over time and how it affects our health. I use data from Berkeley Earth to help make this more visual and understandable through graphs and simple explanations.Iplan to  want to add an interactive element, in tge map page like a clickable world map, where users can choose a country or region and see pollution trends for that place. I think this would make the site more fun and useful, especially for people who want to learn about their own area. It would be really cool to connect the data directly to the map so that people can explore it in a more personal and hands-on way.Eventually, I might even try to link it with health facts or events like wildfires or lockdowns to see let us know  how pollution changes in real life and whats the influcence
